# Runbox 7 shared libraries

Since Runbox 7 is capable of running the search index (Xapian) inside the browser, the web client and
the server side search index runs much of the same code.

The library expose the code for use with the serverside search index or possibly other standalone search
index tools.

Interfaces exposed in the library are defined in src/app/lib.module.ts
